a:[["$","p",null,{"children":"How many bits (one eighth of a byte) are in a dollar? On October 31st, 2008 a paper was published to a cryptography mailing list titled, ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ by Satoshi Nakamoto. Shortly after, the Bitcoin network was established and the ledger began to populate. Instantly, sites such as “Bitcointalk” were founded for discussions related to Bitcoin as the currency was still relatively new and mysterious. While Satoshi’s account on the forums went inactive, Bitcoin grew to be a global commodity, currency, and store of value, but this didn’t come without limitations."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Bitcoin was created as the first peer-to-peer fully digital cash system that provides the ability to transfer currency without the need of consensus by a central bank or authority (Nakamoto, 2008). Due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, there was never any centralized marketing effort put into Bitcoin, as the goal of marketing is to generate revenue and therefore profit. Some would argue that the early adopters of such currency would have motivations of such marketing as an increase in demand would increase the value of their holdings. However, true adopters of Bitcoin do not see its fiat value as a determining factor of its worth, as its goal is to dismantle such industries."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Bitcoin was created with longevity in mind. Bitcoin’s core foundation revolves around the idea of a blockchain, or an ever growing collection of blocks which contain Bitcoin transactions (ledger), which are stored on nodes (Bitcoin network). As long as there are nodes to broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network and miners to secure the network through verifying said transactions, the Bitcoin network will persist. Given current circumstances, it’s very likely that Bitcoin’s blockchain will forever be maintained."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"When Bitcoin was first introduced to the world in 2009 it was worth a whopping $0. Bitcoin’s early adopters did not see Bitcoin as something that was meant to be worth a large sum of money. They saw it as a project which aimed to make strides in the realm of decentralized finance. Instead, these users aimed to help improve, optimize, and fix bugs in Bitcoin’s code. As long as a majority of 51% of miners is reached, then updates can be made to Bitcoin’s existing code.  Since Bitcoin was still a relatively small network, deploying these changes to the decentralized chain was relatively easy as a 51% majority could be acquired."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"It was not until Bitcoin began to be traded that it gained inherent value. One of the most infamous trades in Bitcoin’s early phases was on May 22, 2010, when an early adopter traded 10,000 ($600 million at today's evaluation) Bitcoins to buy two pizzas, which is now known as “Bitcoin Pizza Day”. This is when Bitcoin began to gain value and was actually utilized as intended. CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) began to be developed and people began investing in or buying Bitcoin."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Alternatives to Bitcoin (Altcoins) began to pop-up, claiming higher transactions per second, better mining rewards, and an overall improved user experience. Due to Bitcoin’s decentralized, open-source nature combined with the decentralized consensus allowing for modifications of the chain in real-time, developers began to fork Bitcoin’s code. Many coins have attempted to dethrone Bitcoin, but none have been successful in their attempts due to Bitcoin’s unique nature and first-mover advantage."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"In Bitcoin’s middle years it made great strides in value. In 2013, Bitcoin reached $1,000 before crashing and bottoming out around $300. In 2014, Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, was hacked and over 740,000 Bitcoins were stolen by hackers. A large portion of these Bitcoins “belonged” to users as they held them in their wallet on the site. This incident raised doubts in the Bitcoin community; as since users held their coins inside the exchange’s wallets, their Bitcoins were also stolen. This is not to say Bitcoin was hacked, but rather that a vulnerable entity’s wallets were gained access too, leading to all of the user's coins being stolen as well."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"One of Bitcoin’s core principles is that it allows for the user to fully control their funds. In 2014, the Bitcoin community learned a valuable lesson, one in which is the fabric of the entirety of Bitcoin and its mission. If you do not possess the private keys for your crypto wallet, then it’s not your crypto. Additionally, if a third party possesses the private keys for your crypto wallet (all third party managed wallets); then you are sharing your Bitcoin. To further this issue, third party wallets are prone to outages, leading to the user not being able to access their funds temporarily. Bitcoin was founded to empower the end user by effectively making them their own bank. They can access their Bitcoins whenever, wherever, and if anything happens to them it is not a central party's fault, it is strictly the end user's responsibility of their coins."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"As of today, the biggest threat to Bitcoin is centralization; the very thing Bitcoin was created to destroy. Bitcoin was created to rival centralized financial companies like PayPal. Similar centralization can be seen entering the crypto-sphere, as new companies begin to offer online services in which users store their Bitcoin on. A perfect example is Coinbase, which has grown to be a major exchange, wallet, and bridge between users’ crypto and their bank. This idea of third parties harboring users’ Bitcoin goes directly against Bitcoin’s rationale (Nakamoto, 2008)  Connections can be made to the internet, which was originally founded as a distributed network, but slowly drifted towards centralization due to third party companies gaining influence in the sphere. Starosielski (2015) describes how the infrastructure of the internet is “Not only is it wired, but it is also relatively centralized--far from the early vision of the Internet as a rhizomatic and distributed network.” (p. 2)."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Bitcoin’s future is also threatened by concerns of scalability. Bitcoin is incredibly slow by today’s standards of consensus algorithms. With new blockchains such as Algorand boasting 64,000 transactions per second versus Bitcoin’s mere three transactions per second. As Thorsrud explains, “With 3.7 transactions per second, Bitcoin is incapable of competing with Visa at an average of 2000 transactions per second, and that is on a regular basis.” (p. 38). It is quite clear that with Bitcoin’s current implementation of decentralized consensus it is not able to efficiently handle the weight of global finance as a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Another major issue with Bitcoin is its inefficiency. As of recently, it is known that the banking industry consumes around 2.5x more energy annually than the Bitcoin network (Namcios, 2021). While this may seem like great news, Bitcoin is still in its infancy stages so this energy usage in comparison to the banking industry; which is much larger in size, shows Bitcoin is quite inefficient. Another environmental concern of Bitcoin is the e-waste generated from the components used to generate the computing power necessary for mining; such as graphics cards."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"So where does that leave Bitcoin today? The Bitcoin community has long realized that Bitcoin is not the end product of a decentralized cash system. Bitcoin has more effectively taken the role of a decentralized, fixed commodity, that is a store of value. Baur and Dimpfl (2021) outline this briefly, “be argued that the price did not fall over sufficiently long periods and that Bitcoin shows store of value properties. This argument is supported by Bitcoin’s fixed supply and thus “deflationary design” compared with fiat currencies.” It is clear why Bitcoin would adopt the role of being a store of value. One Bitcoin will always be equal to one Bitcoin and no new Bitcoin will be created past the fixed supply limit, effectively making Bitcoin comparable to gold. However, Bitcoin is able to be exchanged globally whereas moving a large amount of gold is quite intensive."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"What is often overlooked is what happens if you are to discard your Bitcoin. This effect can be described utilizing simple supply and demand. Bitcoin’s supply has a fixed limit so there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in circulation after all Bitcoins have been mined. Bitcoins are discarded due to someone losing their private keys, losing their password to their wallet, or on purpose, all other Bitcoins in circulation are inherently worth more. So while Bitcoin has a max supply of 21 million Bitcoins, it has been reported that around 3.7 million Bitcoins haven’t been touched for at least half a decade (Phillips, 2021). This makes Bitcoins’ max supply technically lower if those coins are lost and enriches the value of everyone else's coins."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Overall, Bitcoin has already left a noticeable impact on society. Bitcoin has shaped the decentralized finance sphere; consequently empowering millions of people. Bitcoin has demonstrated what a truly decentralized peer-to-peer cashless system would look like. With countries such as El Salvador accepting Bitcoin as legal tender and developers actively working to fix the inefficiency of Bitcoin’s consensus, Bitcoin could be a viable cash system like it was originally intended to be. While all of this seems great for Bitcoin, innovation is necessary, and it has a long road ahead if it wants to accomplish its mission."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["References\nSatoshi, Nakamoto.
