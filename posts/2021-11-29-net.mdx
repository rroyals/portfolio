What does the Internet have to do with economics and policy? This weird crossover of economics and policy into the infrastructure of the Internet have sparked a debate over a topic called net neutrality. Net neutrality can simply be defined as equal treatment of transmission of data over the internet by ISPs. An example of this would be an Internet service provider (ISP) restricting access to competitors' websites. While economics and policy have a role in the debate of net neutrality, Internet infrastructure is often an overlooked factor that essentially provides the foundation on which the net neutrality debate is built on.

The Internet was originally a private network for a few select universities to exchange messages (Jan Krämer, 2012). The infrastructure of this system was very simple: packets were routed autonomously and their content or source was not a determining factor for transmission. Due to this configuration, if routers’ queues were full, packets would be dropped no matter their importance. Although the net neutrality debate had not existed at the time, the non-discrimination rule established by Congress in 2006 (Schuett, 2010), states that no intermediate node can influence the network by favoring one packet over another. However, this infrastructural design is only effective for the simple transmission of texts whereas phone calls require more specific differentiation of packets due to the necessary low latency required for voice communications. This need for differentiation between packets led to the evolution of Internet protocol.

On January 1st, 1983, the Internet protocol switched to IPv4, which included a specified type of service in the packets’ header, allowing for routers to differentiate packets. This differentiation of packets is known as quality of service (QoS). Following the evolution of the Internet protocol, the Internet grew to become a household necessity and private corporations began to invest heavily into infrastructure for ISPs. However, this adoption of the Internet didn’t go unnoticed by regulators and politicians.

As this growth continued, politicians began to worry how ISPs may take advantage of consumers given their grip on the Internet. Due to this shift, academic writing has a clear focus on policy regarding the net neutrality debate because of the influence ISPs have on the internet. This is when the net neutrality debate began, as regulators had to decide whether the Internet should be a free market or follow a regulated model that prevents control of traffic by ISPs. Unfortunately, this is a much more complicated debate due to there being no fine line between certain types of control and management of inner networks by ISPs, such as ISPs need to prioritize voice communications over text communications due to the necessary low latency as discussed earlier. Due to this prioritization, there is not a correct definition of net neutrality, but rather ‘strict’ and ‘less strict’ definitions. Jan Krämer’s (2012) provides a strict definition “Net neutrality prohibits Internet service providers from speeding up, slowing down or blocking Internet traffic based on its source, ownership or destination”. (p. 796)

Academic writing has also approached the net neutrality debate from an economic point of view; leaving infrastructure untouched. The economic component of the net neutrality debate could be confused with the infrastructural component, but as we will discuss infrastructure later it’s made clear these are two separate systems that go hand in hand. Jan Krämer (2012) outlines the effects of the two-sided economic market in relation to the Internet, “ISPs are the operators of a two-sided market platform that connects the suppliers of content and services (CSP) with the consumers (IUs) that demand these services.” Due to this necessary connection by ISPs, positive relations between CSPs and ISPs ensure more revenue for both sides.

One of the main issues seen with this two-sided market system is the potential exploitation of consumers by ISPs by imposing an extra fee for data transmitted from CSPs to consumers. This extra charge for data transmission could be seen as a net neutrality violation as traffic would be blocked from users if extra fees were not paid. Hahn and Wallsten (2006) provides a less strict net neutrality definition that encapsulates the issue of extra fees “Net neutrality usually means that broadband service providers charge consumers only once for Internet access, do not favor one content provider over another, and do not charge content providers for sending information over broadband lines to end users.” (p. 1)

As you can see, net neutrality is a more complex debate than just ISPs conflicting with users’ data. This is largely due to the differing definitions regarding net neutrality, but mostly all definitions revolve around the general consensus of ISPs not conflicting with, altering, or blocking data transmitted to consumers. Another possible violation of net neutrality arises when ISPs begin to mitigate traffic seen as unprofitable. For example, an ISP censoring possible competitors advertising, which could be seen as unprofitable, could be seen as a net neutrality violation.

This concept of ISPs managing and filtering traffic was placed at the forefront of the Internet in 2008. A large scandal regarding Comcast arose in 2008, in which Comcast was found restricting peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic. The FCC intervened quickly and Comcast was served a cease or desist order. Comcast’s actions can be directly linked to the economic component of the net neutrality debate. P2P traffic is generated and transmitted directly to and from end users. Due to the peer-to-peer nature of the traffic, ISPs are not able to monetize this traffic nearly as effectively as traffic funneled from CSPs, leading to Comcast outright restricting certain P2P traffic.

However, this issue of degradation of P2P traffic still continues. Dischinger et al. (2010) conducted a study in Germany regarding this limitation of P2P traffic. Software was developed that allowed for consumers to monitor how much ISPs were interfering with their P2P data transmission. The study found that ten percent of consumers tested indicated a deep packet inspection (DPI) percentage of greater than zero, indicating that all ISPs were in violation of interference of consumers' data transmission throughout the day. Kabel Deutschland indicated the largest DPI, with thirty nine percent of P2P traffic being interfered with.

Due to this continuation of filtration, censorship, and restriction, abusing the prioritization of data remains one of the main focuses of the net neutrality debate. Due to the addition of IPv4 discussed earlier, ISPs can easily decide how to handle certain packets. There are two outcomes that are of concern to net neutrality. The first outcome is that the ISP prevents the packet(s) from being delivered to the consumer; which would be considered blocking. The second outcome is that the ISP reduces or degrades the transmission of the packet(s), which would be considered degradation.

These outcomes only intensify in complexity as you explore the relation to net neutrality. For instance, all evidence of blocking by ISPs is anecdotal, as how are you going to prove a packet was not received. The main concern of blocking in relation to net neutrality is the possible censorship of opinions and the limitations of freedom of speech in countries where this is applicable. Degradation provides for a more solid argument, as concrete evidence of degradation already exists, as seen in the Comcast and German ISPs limitations of P2P traffic. However, this issue quickly becomes complex as ISPs technically need to provide prioritization to establish QoS. Unfortunately, this creates a gray area of what is justifiable and unjust prioritization.

Due to this gray area and ISPs influence as discussed earlier, the policy component of the net neutrality debate has gained traction. In 2004, the FCC Chairman Michael Powell highlighted the FCC’s view on the development of the Internet Friedlander, S. A. (2016). He stated that the FCC wanted to promote investment in more diverse, robust technologies regarding the Internet that empower American consumers. He also took a very deregulatory standpoint regarding the development of the Internet and stated that Congress should make sure to not slow the growth of the Internet. Most interestingly, he called for the telecommunications industry to protect Internet freedoms. These Internet freedoms included Freedom to Access Content, Freedom to Use Applications, Freedom to Attach Personal Devices, Freedom to Obtain Service Plan Information.

While policy and economics are a large contributor to the net neutrality debate, infrastructure is often an overlooked contributor. Current implementations of internet infrastructure; specifically DNS, are relatively insecure due to their centralization and non-neutral format. Bills introduced by congress in 2011, such as the Stop Online Piracy Act and PROTECT IP Act, prove this insecurity as they essentially shatter the current DNS systems due to their demands for filtering of DNS records on demand in the US (Benshoof, 2016). Other concerns have arisen regarding the current state of certificate authorities such as TLS and SSL. This is largely due to information that has been released regarding the NSA’s ability to spy on and monitor citizens. The purpose of TLS and SSL is to encrypt or protect the transmission of data, so if governments are able to easily circumvent this encryption, then it would not be a stretch to assume that skilled hackers are able to do the same.

Infrastructurally, certificate authorities (TLS/SSL) can adjust their encryption rather easily in comparison to altering our entire DNS infrastructure; in which is already rooted into the infrastructure of the internet. Due to this, proposed revisions to the current DNS system must be made with cooperation between current systems in mind. A proposal was made to have DNS function off of a distributed hash table (DHT). This idea of a key-value pair in relation to DNS was then applied to current developments of cryptocurrencies; most specifically, blockchain related technology. This approach is known as Distributed Decentralized Domain Name Service (D3NS).

D3NS proposes a more robust DNS system that eliminates the security flaws seen in the current DNS framework, allowing for a more neutral and less centralized experience for users. Essentially, D3NS operates on top of current DNS systems, storing DNS records over a DHT that can then be accessed through your regular public/private key blockchain based system. On top of the added security benefits of D3NS, it has also been reported that latency is much lower than standard DHT systems (Benshoof, 2016). This change in infrastructure to solidify DNS records on a blockchain actually provides for a more net neutral experience; referring to our first definition of net neutrality, D3NS prevents blocking or rerouting of DNS related queries.

An infrastructural change could easily disrupt the current net neutrality debate, as it would provide for a more neutral net. While policy and economic related factors have a large influence on the debate of net neutrality, it is surprising to see the lack of influence of infrastructure on such a debate. Although, if these implemented systems were to make an appearance at a large scale the net neutrality debate would have to evolve to incorporate these new systems; much like with policy. It is safe to say that infrastructure will have an affect on the future of the internet, and therefore the future net neutrality.
